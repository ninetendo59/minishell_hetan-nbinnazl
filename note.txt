Done
- minishell Core structure 
- handling ctrl c, ctrl d, ctrl \
- displaying current directory & minishell program name


Fix
- ctrl + D need to behave like in bash (using exit)
- ctrl + C need to behave like in bash and clear whatever instruction floating
- minishell bash info need to be static (in case forget: MINISHELL:{cwd})
- need to have overall env support with secret env instead of just builtin env

Done by Nizar
- cd shell
- echo shell
    --> -n flag
- env with no arg/options
- exit shell (easy)
- export shell
- pwd shell
- unset shell

Planning
- handle command input (valid)
- handle error (input invalid)
- handle valid command but invalid syntax
- ls shell
- handle single quote prevent dollar sign to be interpreted
- handle double quote prevent dollar sign to be interpreted
- working history (up down key)
- not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which not required (bs and semicolon)
- handle '<', '>', '<<' and '>>'
- handle pipes '|'
- Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which should expand to their values
- ensure no leaks when code

if we able to complete all above then try to do bonus
- handle double ampersand && and double pipe || with parenthesis for being priotised
- handle wildcards '*' which should be working for current dir
